    The XGBoost model training process is fully automated in Vertex AI Pipelines and consists of the following key stages:
    - Preprocessing:
      - Converts categorical features into numerical representations.
      - Handles missing values using imputation techniques.
      - Scales numerical values for consistency.
    - Feature Selection:
      - Uses LASSO Regression to identify the most predictive features.
      - Removes low-importance features based on feature importance scores from XGBoost.
    - Model Training:
      - Trains an XGBoost Classifier with optimized hyperparameters.
      - Uses Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, and min_child_weight.
    - Model Evaluation:
      - Calculates key metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
      - Generates confusion matrices for better interpretability.
    - Model Registration:
      - Saves the trained XGBoost model into Vertex AI Model Registry for version control.
    - Model Deployment:
      - Deploys the best-performing model to Vertex AI Endpoints for real-time inference.

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file to specify your variables (replace placeholders with actual values):
* See [terraform.tfvars.development](./terraform/terraform.tfvars.development)
```bash
project_id = "gcp-project-id"
region     = "region"
...
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform
Initialize Terraform to download the required provider plugins and set up the backend:
```bash
cd terraform

terraform init
```

### 4. Plan the Deployment
Generate and review the execution plan to verify the resources that will be created:
```bash
terraform plan
```

### 5. Apply the Deployment
Deploy the resources on GCP:
```bash
terraform apply
```
Confirm the prompt with `yes` to proceed.

### 6. Verify Deployment
Once the deployment completes:
- Check the GCP Console to verify the resources.
- Ensure all services are running as expected.

### 7. Retrieve Outputs
Retrieve the Terraform outputs to generate a report:
```bash
terraform output -json > pipeline_report.json
```

### 8. Clean Up (Optional)
To tear down the deployed infrastructure:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
Go to cloud console and delete/disable resources and services if not so:
- Cloud SQL             # Application Authentication
- BigQuery              # Vertex AI Feature Store
- VPC Network           # VPC
- Vertex AI             # Feature store, Model Registry, Pipelines
- GCS                   # Cloud Buckets
- GKE                   # Kubernetes Cluster
- Artifacts Registry    # Atifact Registry (AKA: GCR)

---

## Notes

### Troubleshooting
- If Terraform fails to authenticate, verify your GCP credentials:
  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```
- Ensure the service account has the necessary permissions.
- Check logs for specific errors using:
  ```bash
  terraform show
  ```

### Create/Update Docker Container Images
- **MLOps App**:
  ```bash
  terraform apply -replace="null_resource.mlops_app_docker_build"
  ```
- **Vertex AI Model Endpoint Custom Container**:
  ```bash
  terraform apply -replace="null_resource.vertexai_endpoint_middleware"
  ```
